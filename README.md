# ThresholdDebouncer

Arduino Lib to de-bounce a signal compared to a threshold and trigger a callback like single event, ongoing long event... Usefull for capacitive touch interface like the one on the Adafruit Circuit Playground.

Heavily inspired from Button Fever Library by Mickey Chan for the callback logic, so hats off to him: [ButtonFever Github Page](https://github.com/mickey9801/ButtonFever)

# Installation
The lib is not available on Arduino Library Manager for now so installation is made by [Downloading or cloning this repository into your arduino libraries directory](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
